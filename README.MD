# Improving Automatic Test Case Generation by predicting optimal Fitness Functions

This is a repo for the code that comes with my Bachelor thesis, 
as written for the Research Project (CSE 3000) at TU Delft.

The thesis can be found [here](http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:33e63337-2f99-4d5e-9e84-ed23ae0824c9).

In order to use, all figures and graphs can be recreated using `figures_tables.py` script. 
The data that the script uses can be found in the `data` folder.

## Usage:
```
$ git clone [link]
$ cd [folder]
```
Instructions using venv, or use whatever you prefer:
```
$ python -m venv venv
$ source ./venv/bin/activate
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python figures_tables.py
```
